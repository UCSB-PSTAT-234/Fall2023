# Coursework and Grading

The goal of the course is to learn data science concepts and apply them for analyzing real-world datasets. You are expected to write your own code throughout this course. 

If you are comfortable with Python at a level similar to [_Introduction to Python_ DataCamp course](#datacamp-courses), you would be able to learn to use libraries at the level of _Python for Data Science_ book. If the DataCamp course content is new to you, you are advised to take additional DataCamp courses to learn Python basics early on in the quarter. 


## Coursework & Grading

- **Attendance**: Bringing a laptop to class is recommended but not required. Check out [campus laptop resources](https://food.ucsb.edu/resources/technology-resources) to obtain one if you don't own a laptop.

- **Midterm (20%)**: The exam will be open-computer and open-internet pen/paper exam. More information will be provided prior to the exam. 

- **DataCamp Assignments (20%)** [[Join link]](https://www.datacamp.com/groups/shared_links/6dc17af608bfda4663595a34dc48069d10b88f8a42a1610beb357e90abaea43f): DataCamp exercises and assignments are for learning at your own pace. Datacamp deadlines CANNOT be extended, but you may work on them in advance. use your `@ucsb.edu` or `@umail.ucsb.edu` address

## Coursework

- **Assignments (30%)**: Assignments are designed for you to practice the material, which is the only way one can truly excel in it. Problem sets will contain data analysis exercises as well as conceptual questions. (10% penalty per day. Not accepted after 5 late days)

- **Final Project (30%)**: You will hav a chance to pitch your project idea to class and recruit your team!
